Bisect
======

Bisect is an Android app for helping you run bisects or binary searches. It
lets you input a starting point, an end point, and the type of search, and
then it tells you what number to try next. Since you're likely not going to
complete your search in one sitting, it'll save your searches for later in a
convenient list!

This is definitely a **work in progress**. It's not even functional yet.
